//! Ubra's agent skills: the detailed rules for a Ubra capability, kept out of

//!
//! Each body is plain Markdown in `skills/`. The Engine writes them into a
//! Claude Code plugin (`--plugin-dir`), where they load as native skills named
//! `ubra:<name>`; every other agent reads them with the `get_skill` MCP tool.
//! The short instructions only say which skill covers what.
